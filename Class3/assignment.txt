1. Write a function for checking the speed of drivers. This function should have one parameter: speed.
If speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok".
Otherwise, for every 5km above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. 
For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”.
If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: "License suspended"


Hint:
Use while loop to get input.
On exit input. It should break loop.
input value should be greater than 0.


2. Create a basic calculator with basic operations.
	add, subtract, multiply, divide, and moduls.
	Input 2 numbers from users
	Input operation type.
	Create functions for operations and call those functions accodingly.
	Show results.
